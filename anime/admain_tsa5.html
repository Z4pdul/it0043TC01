He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.</p>

Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates, whose actions eventually entangled him in the Summit War of Marineford. Inadvertently, the war grew his reputation enough to become one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea,[7] whereupon he founded the pirate mercenary organization Buggy's Delivery.[3] After the Warlord system was abolished,[15] he recreated it as the Cross Guild in partnership with fellow ex-Warlords Dracule Mihawk and Crocodile. He is currently recognized as the Guild's public leader, and on its power one of the Four Emperors.[6][2][16]</p>
